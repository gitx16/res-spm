Placeholder attributes are valid on `input` elements of various types and `textarea` elements.\n\nPlaceholders.js is licensed under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). See the unminified file for the full license text.\n\n## Get it!\n\nDownload the polyfill and get a whole load of information and instructions at [our new website](http://jamesallardice.github.com/Placeholders.js/).\n    \n##Supported Browsers\n\nPlaceholders.js aims to support the widest range of browsers possible. The idea is that you will be able to use the native `placeholder` attribute along with Placeholders.js and your users on any platform will get the same experience. This table will be updated as and when further browsers are tested. Mobile browser testing is a big one that's high on the list. Currently tested and working in the following browsers on (where applicable) both Windows 7 and CentOS 6:\n\n - Internet Explorer 6 - 9 (with Placeholders.js)\n - Firefox 1 - 3 (with Placeholders.js), 4+ (native)\n - Opera 7 - 10 (with Placeholders.js), 11+ (native)\n - Safari 3.2 (with Placeholders.js), 4+ (native)\n - Chrome 4+ (native)\n - Flock 1.0+ (with Placeholders.js)\n - Konqueror 4.3 (with Placeholders.js)\n - SeaMonkey 1+ (with Placeholders.js)\n - Maxthon 1+ (with Placeholders.js)\n - SlimBrowser 5 (with Placeholders.js)\n - K-Meleon 0.7+ (with Placeholders.js)\n\nDo you use some obscure browser that doesn't have native `placeholder` attribute support? If so, please let me know so I can make sure Placeholders.js works with it.", "devDependencies": {"grunt-contrib-jshint": "0.3.x", "grunt": "0.4.x", "grunt-contrib-concat": "0.1.x", "grunt-contrib-uglify": "0.2.x"}, "tag": "stable", "homepage": "http://jamesallardice.github.io/Placeholders.js/", "md5": "ec98813e8629cbd2310f2b6cddae057d", "description": "A JavaScript polyfill for the HTML5 placeholder attribute"}
